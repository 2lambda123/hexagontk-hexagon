These libraries provide single standalone features 1 and are referred to as \"Ports\" . The main ports are: The HTTP server : supports HTTPS, HTTP/2, mutual TLS, static files (serve and upload), forms processing, cookies, sessions, CORS and more. The HTTP client : which supports mutual TLS, HTTP/2, cookies, form fields and files among other features. Template Processing : allows template processing from URLs (local files, resources or HTTP content) binding name patterns to different engines. Each of these features or ports may have different implementations called \"Adapters\" . Hexagon is designed to fit in applications that conform to the Hexagonal Architecture (also called Clean Architecture or Ports and Adapters Architecture ). Its design principles also fit into this architecture. Hello World \u00b6 Simple Hello World HTTP example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 package com.hexagonkt.http.server.jetty import com.hexagonkt.http.server.Server lateinit var server : Server /** * Start a Hello World server, serving at path \"/hello\". */ fun main () { server = serve { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } } You can check the code examples and demo projects for more complex use cases. Features \u00b6 Hexagon's goals and design principles: Put you in Charge : There is no code generation, no runtime annotation processing, no classpath based logic, and no implicit behaviour. You control your tools, not the other way around. Modular : Each feature (Port) or adapter is isolated in its own module. Use only the modules you need without carrying unneeded dependencies. Pluggable Adapters : Every Port may have many implementations (Adapters) using different technologies. You can swap adapters without changing the application code. Batteries Included : It contains all the required pieces to make production-grade applications: logging utilities, serialization, resource handling and build helpers. Kotlin First : Take full advantage of Kotlin instead of just calling Java code from Kotlin. The library is coded in Kotlin for coding with Kotlin. No strings attached to Java (as a Language). Properly Tested : The project's coverage is checked in every Pull Request. It is also stress-tested at TechEmpower Frameworks Benchmark . Not in Scope \u00b6 Kotlin Native : because of the added complexity of Kotlin Native, focus will be set on the JVM platform, native binaries' generation will rely on GraalVM. Architecture \u00b6 How Hexagon fits in your architecture in a picture.

The toolkit ports are designed to work on their own. For example: you can use the http_server module without importing the templates one, and the other way around (taking only the dependencies you need for your application). Adapter \u00b6 They are implementations of a functionality (Port) for a given product/technology. Clients should only use ports' code (not Adapters specific code), this makes it easy to switch among different adapters with minimum impact. Adapters are independent of each other, but you can use several adapters for the same port in a single application. Manager \u00b6 Singleton object to manage a cross toolkit aspect. I.e., Serialization, Logging or Templates. Toolkit Structure \u00b6 The project is composed of modules, each module provides a single functionality. There are three kinds of modules: The ones that provide functionality that does not depend on different implementations, like core . Their name always starts with the hexagon_ prefix. These modules can depend on several Ports, but never on Adapters (see below). Modules that define one or more related \"Ports\": these are interfaces to a feature that may have different implementations (i.e., http_server or templates ). They cannot be used by themselves and in their place, an adapter implementing them should be added to the list of dependencies. These modules' names start with the port_ prefix. Ports are independent of each other. Adapter modules, which are Port implementations for a given tool, http_client_ahc , and http_server_jetty are examples of this type of module. Adapter names must start with their port name. Hexagon Core \u00b6 The Hexagon Core module is used by all other libraries, so it would be added to your project anyway just by using any adapter. Core utilities like, logging and serialization. Toolkit's ports are designed to use core functionalities. You can use a third party DI library instead of using the Core one. The main features are the following: Helpers : JVM information, a logger and other useful utilities. Objects Serialization : parse/serialize data in different formats to class instances. Other Modules \u00b6 The following libraries provide extra features not bound to different implementations. They will not use dependencies outside the Hexagon toolkit. Web : this module is meant to ease web application development. Provides helpers for generating HTML and depends on the HTTP Server and Templates ports. Toolkit Ports \u00b6 These modules define features that need a specific implementation. You can use many implementations of each port at the same time. You can even provide a custom implementation if you want to optimize a particular use case. These are the implemented ports: HTTP Server : describes how to use HTTP routing and HTML templates for Web services. HTTP Client : documentation to use the HTTP client module to connect to other services. Templates : describes how to render pages using template engines.","title":"Developer Guide"},{"location":"developer_guide/#concepts","text":"","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"developer_guide/#port","text":"It is an interface for a task.

It is possible to add/change variables of a build from the following places: In the project's gradle.properties file. In your user's gradle configuration: ~/.gradle/gradle.properties . Passing them from the command line with the following switch: -Pkey=val . Defining a project's extra property inside build.gradle . Ie: project.ext.key='val' . For examples and reference, check build.gradle and gradle.properties . Helper scripts \u00b6 These scripts can be added to your build to include a whole new capability to your building logic. To use them, you can import the online versions, or copy them to your gradle directory before importing the script. You can import these scripts by adding add apply from: $gradleScripts/$script.gradle to your build.gradle file some of them may require additional plugins inside the plugins section in the root build.gradle . Check toolkit build.gradle files for examples. Publish \u00b6 This script set up the project/module for publishing in Maven Central . It publishes all artifacts attached to the mavenJava publication (check kotlin.gradle publishing section) at the bare minimum binaries are published. For an Open Source project, you must include sources and javadoc. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/publish.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: bintrayKey (REQUIRED): if not defined will try to load BINTRAY_KEY environment variable. bintrayUser (REQUIRED): or BINTRAY_USER environment variable if not defined. license (REQUIRED): the license used in published POMs. vcsUrl (REQUIRED): code repository location. Dokka \u00b6 This script set up Dokka tool and add a JAR with the project's code documentation to the published JARs. It adds the following extra task: dokkaJar: create a jar file with the source code documentation in Javadoc format. All modules' Markdown files are added to the documentation and test classes ending in SamplesTest are available to be referenced as samples. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/dokka.gradle and add the id 'org.jetbrains.dokka' version 'VERSION' plugin to the root build.gradle . The format for the generated documentation will be javadoc to make it compatible with current IDEs. Icons \u00b6 Create web icons (favicon and thumbnails for browsers/mobile) from image SVGs (logos). For image rendering you will need rsvg (librsvg2-bin) and imagemagick installed in the development machine. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/icons.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: logo (REQUIRED): SVG file used to render the logos. Used for the favicon. logoLarge: SVG file used to render the large logo. If not supplied 'logo' will be used. logoWide: SVG file used to render the wide logo. Used for MS Windows tiles. If not provided 'logoLarge' will be used. Kotlin \u00b6 Adds Kotlin's Gradle plugin. Uses JUnit 5 as the test framework. It also includes MockK in the test classpath. It sets up: Java version Repositories Kotlin dependencies Resource processing (replacing build variables) Cleaning (deleting runtime files as logs and dump files) Tests run, handles properties, output, and mocks (test's output depends on Gradle logging level) Set up coverage report IDE settings for IntelliJ and Eclipse (download dependencies' sources and API documentation) Published artifacts (binaries and sources): sourcesJar task To use it, apply $gradleScripts/kotlin.gradle and add the id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm' version 'VERSION' plugin to the root build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: kotlinVersion: Kotlin version. Defaults to the version used in the matching Hexagon release. mockkVersion: MockK mocking library version. If no value is supplied, Hexagon's version is taken. junitVersion: JUnit version (5+), the default value is the toolkit version. basePackage: Module's base package (used by the Jacoco Report when using Kotlin Coding Standard) Application \u00b6 Gradle's script for a service or application. It adds these extra tasks: buildInfo: add configuration file ( META-INF/build.properties ) with build variables to the package. It is executed automatically before compiling classes. watch: run the application in another thread. Allows the possibility to watch source changes. To run the application and watch for changes you need to execute this task with the --continuous ( -t ) Gradle flag. Ie: gw -t watch . jarAll: creates a single JAR with all dependencies, and the application main class set up. This task is an alternative to the Gradle installDist task. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/application.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script you need to add the main class name to your build.gradle file with the following code: 1 2 3 application { mainClass . set ( \"com.example.ApplicationKt\" ) } Certificates \u00b6 Creates the required key stores for development purposes. IMPORTANT these key stores must not be used for production environments. The created key stores are: ca.p12 : self-signed certificate authority (CA). This store holds the CA private key. The store must be private and will be used to sign other certificates. The key pair alias is ca . trust.p12 : key store with CA's public certificate. It can be set as the Java process trust store which makes every certificate signed with the CA trusted. However, if used as the trust store, the JDK cacerts entries won't be loaded and thus, not trusted. It can be used to set up HTTPS clients (not required to be set at JVM level). <domain>.p12 : there would be one per each domain (see sslDomain variable). These stores are signed by the CA, and they contain the service private key and its full chain certificate. <domain> will be the domain name without the TLD, and the Subject alternative names (SAN) will include <domain>.test ( TLD for local environments ) and localhost (along the extra subdomains specified). The defined tasks are: createCa: creates ca.p12 and import its public certificate inside trust.p12 . createIdentities: creates the <domain>.p12 store for all sslDomain variables. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/certificates.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: sslDomain[1-9] (REQUIRED): the main domain for the identity store. You can create up to ten (from sslDomain to sslDomain9 ). Each of these variables has the format subdomain1|subdomain2|subdomainN|domain.tld subdomains are added to <domain>.p12 alternative names (aside of <domain>.test and localhost which are always added). By default, no extra domains are added to the key store. sslOrganization (REQUIRED): organization stated in created certificates. sslCaFile: certificate authority key store file. By default: \"ca.p12\". sslCaAlias: CA alias in the key store. If not provided, it will be \"ca\". sslTrustFile: trust store file name, by default it is \"trust.p12\". sslPath: path used to generate the key stores. By default, it will be the project's build directory. sslPassword: password used for the generated key stores. By default, it is the file name reversed. sslValidity: validity period (in days) for certificates. If not provided, it will be 365. sslCountry: country used in the certificates. By default, it is the current locale's country code. Lean \u00b6 This script changes the default Gradle source layout to be less bulky. To use it you must apply the $gradleScripts/lean.gradle script to your build.gradle file. It must be applied after the Kotlin plugin. After applying this script, the source folders will be ${projectDir}/main and ${projectDir}/test , and the resources will be stored also in these folders. Detekt \u00b6 This script sets up the build to analyze the code with the Detekt static code analyzer. To use it you must apply the $gradleScripts/detekt.gradle script to your build.gradle file. It must be applied after the Kotlin plugin. For the script to work you need to add the plugin to the plugins build section before importing the script. I.e.: 1 2 3 plugins { id ( \"io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt\" ) version \"VERSION\" apply false } To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: detektConfigPath: file with Detekt rules and settings.

IMPORTANT these key stores must not be used for production environments. The created key stores are: ca.p12 : self-signed certificate authority (CA). This store holds the CA private key. The store must be private and will be used to sign other certificates. The key pair alias is ca . trust.p12 : key store with CA's public certificate. It can be set as the Java process trust store which makes every certificate signed with the CA trusted. However, if used as the trust store, the JDK cacerts entries won't be loaded and thus, not trusted. It can be used to set up HTTPS clients (not required to be set at JVM level). <domain>.p12 : there would be one per each domain (see sslDomain variable). These stores are signed by the CA, and they contain the service private key and its full chain certificate. <domain> will be the domain name without the TLD, and the Subject alternative names (SAN) will include <domain>.test ( TLD for local environments ) and localhost (along the extra subdomains specified). The defined tasks are: createCa: creates ca.p12 and import its public certificate inside trust.p12 . createIdentities: creates the <domain>.p12 store for all sslDomain variables. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/certificates.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . These helper settings are: sslDomain[1-9] (REQUIRED): the main domain for the identity store. You can create up to ten (from sslDomain to sslDomain9 ). Each of these variables has the format subdomain1|subdomain2|subdomainN|domain.tld subdomains are added to <domain>.p12 alternative names (aside of <domain>.test and localhost which are always added). By default, no extra domains are added to the key store. sslOrganization (REQUIRED): organization stated in created certificates. sslCaFile: certificate authority key store file. By default: \"ca.p12\". sslCaAlias: CA alias in the key store. If not provided, it will be \"ca\". sslTrustFile: trust store file name, by default it is \"trust.p12\". sslPath: path used to generate the key stores. By default, it will be the project's build directory. sslPassword: password used for the generated key stores.

You should include an Adapter implementing this feature (as http_client_ahc ) in order to create HTTP clients. Create an HTTP client \u00b6 You create an HTTP Client instance with default options as follows: 1 2 Client ( adapter ) Client ( adapter , \"http://host:1234/base\" ) Settings \u00b6 If you want to configure options for the client, you can create it with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // All client settings parameters are optionals and provide default values Client ( adapter , \"http://host:1234/base\" , ClientSettings ( contentType = \"application/json\" , useCookies = true , headers = mapOf ( \"X-Api-Key\" to listOf ( \"cafebabe\" )), // Headers to use in all requests user = \"user\" , // HTTP Basic auth user password = \"password\" , // HTTP Basic auth password insecure = false , // If true, the client doesn't check server certificates sslSettings = SslSettings () // Key stores settings (check TLS section for details) )) Send generic requests \u00b6 The most common use case is to send a request and get a response. For details about how to use requests and responses, refer to the Request and the Response API. Check this code snippet to get a glimpse on how to send the most general requests: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 val request = Request ( method = GET , path = \"/\" , body = mapOf ( \"body\" to \"payload\" ), headers = mapOf ( \"X-Header\" to listOf ( \"value\" )), contentType = Json . contentType ) val response = client . send ( request ) Simple requests shortcuts \u00b6 There are utility methods to make the most common request in an easy way.

Check the details in the following code fragment: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 val cookieName = \"sampleCookie\" val cookieValue = \"sampleCookieValue\" // Set the cookie in the client client . cookies [ \"sampleCookie\" ] = Cookie ( cookieName , cookieValue ) // Assert that it is received in the server and change its value afterwards client . post ( \"/assertHasCookie?cookieName= $ cookieName \" ) client . post ( \"/addCookie?cookieName= $ cookieName &cookieValue= ${ cookieValue } _changed\" ) // Verify that the client cookie is updated assert ( client . cookies [ cookieName ]?. value == cookieValue + \"_changed\" ) You can also check the full test for more details. Multipart (forms and files) \u00b6 Using the HTTP client you can send MIME multipart parts to the server. You can use it to post forms or files.

Key stores may have the JKS format (deprecated), or the newer PKCS12 format. To set up client/server certificates, you need to include SslSettings in your ClientSettings . In the sections below you can see how to configure these parameters. Key Store \u00b6 This store holds the identity certificate, this certificate is presented to the server by the client in the handshake for the server to authorize or deny the connection. The following code: 1 2 3 4 val keyStoreSettings = SslSettings ( keyStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ identity \" ), keyStorePassword = identity . reversed () ) Trust Store \u00b6 This key store should include all the trusted certificates. Any certificate added as CA (certificate authority) makes the client trust any other certificate signed by them. However, you can also add standalone server certificates. 1 2 3 4 val trustStoreSettings = SslSettings ( trustStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ trust \" ), trustStorePassword = trust . reversed () ) Mutual TLS \u00b6 If you set up the identity (service's own certificate) and the trust store (CAs and servers trusted by the client), you will achieve double ended authentication (server authenticated by the client, and client authenticated by the server). You can see a complete example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 // Key store files val identity = \"hexagonkt.p12\" val trust = \"trust.p12\" // Default passwords are file name reversed val keyStorePassword = identity . reversed () val trustStorePassword = trust . reversed () // Key stores can be set as URIs to classpath resources (the triple slash is needed) val keyStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ identity \" ) val trustStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ trust \" ) val sslSettings = SslSettings ( keyStore = keyStore , keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword , trustStore = trustStore , trustStorePassword = trustStorePassword , clientAuth = true // Requires a valid certificate from the client (mutual TLS) ) val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( bindPort = 0 , protocol = HTTPS , // You can also use HTTP2 sslSettings = sslSettings ) val server = serve ( serverSettings , serverAdapter ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { // We can access the certificate used by the client from the request val subjectDn = request . certificate ?. subjectDN ?. name response . headers [ \"cert\" ] = subjectDn ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } // We'll use the same certificate for the client (in a real scenario it would be different) val clientSettings = ClientSettings ( sslSettings = sslSettings ) // Create a HTTP client and make a HTTPS request val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"https://localhost: ${ server . runtimePort } \" , clientSettings ) client . get ( \"/hello\" ). apply { logger . debug { body } // Assure the certificate received (and returned) by the server is correct assert ( headers . require ( \"cert\" ). first (). startsWith ( \"CN=hexagonkt.com\" )) assert ( body == \"Hello World!\" ) } Package com.hexagonkt.http.client \u00b6 This package holds the classes that define the HTTP client and its configuration settings.","title":"HTTP Client"},{"location":"http_client/#module-http_client","text":"This port provides a common interface for using HTTP clients.

And allows you to switch implementations without changing the service. The web module provides utilities on top of this port for Web application development (like templates helpers). Install the Dependency \u00b6 This module is not meant to be used directly. You should include and Adapter implementing this feature (as http_server_jetty ) in order to create an HTTP server. Server \u00b6 A server is a process listening to HTTP requests on a TCP port. You can run multiple ones on different ports at the same time (this can be useful to test many microservices at the same time). The server can be configured with different properties. If you do not provide a value for them, they are searched inside the application settings and lastly, a default value is picked. This is the parameters list: banner: informative text shown at start up logs. If not set only runtime information is displayed. bindAddress: address to which this process is bound. If none is provided, 127.0.0.1 is taken. bindPort: the port which the process listens to. By default, it is 2010 . contextPath: initial path used for the rest of the routes, by default it is empty. To create a server, you need to provide a router (check the next section for more information), and after creating a server you can run it or stop it with start() and stop() methods. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 /* * All settings are optional, you can supply any combination * Parameters not set will fall back to the defaults */ val settings = ServerSettings ( bindAddress = InetAddress . getByName ( \"0.0.0\" ), bindPort = 2020 , contextPath = \"/context\" , banner = \"name\" ) val router = Router { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } val customServer = Server ( adapter , router , settings ) customServer . start () val customClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost: ${ customServer . runtimePort } \" ) assert ( customServer . started ()) assert ( customClient . get ( \"/context/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) customServer . stop () /* * You can skip the adapter is you previously bound one * You may also skip the settings and the defaults will be used */ val defaultServer = Server ( adapter , router = router ) defaultServer . start () val defaultClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost: ${ defaultServer . runtimePort } \" ) assert ( defaultServer . started ()) assert ( defaultClient . get ( \"/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) defaultServer . stop () Servlet Web server \u00b6 There is a special server adapter for running inside Servlet Containers. To use it you should import the Servlet HTTP Server Adapter into your project. Check the http_server_servlet module for more information. Routes \u00b6 The main building block of a Hexagon HTTP service is a set of routes. A route is made up of three simple pieces: A verb (get, post, put, delete, head, trace, connect, options). It can also be any . A path (/hello, /users/{name}). Paths must start with '/' and trailing slash is ignored. A callback code block. The callback has a void return type. You should use Call.send() to set the response which will be returned to the user. Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route that matches the request is invoked, and the following ones are ignored. Check the next snippet for usage examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Get greeting\" )} put ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Put greeting\" )} post ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Post greeting\" )} any ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Fallback if HTTP verb was not used before\" )} get { ok ( \"Get at '/' if no route matched before\" ) } HTTP clients will be able to reuse the routes to create REST services clients. Route groups \u00b6 Routes can be nested by calling the path() method, which takes a String prefix and gives you a scope to declare routes and filters (or more nested paths). Ie: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 path ( \"/nested\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Greeting\" )} path ( \"/secondLevel\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Second level greeting\" )} } get { ok ( \"Get at '/nested'\" ) } } Routers \u00b6 If you have a lot of routes, it can be helpful to group them into routers. You can create routers to mount a group of routes in different paths (allowing you to reuse them). Check this snippet: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 fun personRouter ( kind : String ) = Router { get { ok ( \"Get $ kind \" ) } put { ok ( \"Put $ kind \" ) } post { ok ( \"Post $ kind \" ) } } val server = Server ( adapter ) { path ( \"/clients\" , personRouter ( \"client\" )) path ( \"/customers\" , personRouter ( \"customer\" )) } Callbacks \u00b6 Callbacks are request's handling blocks that are bound to routes or filters. They make the request, response and session objects available to the handling code. Call \u00b6 The Call object provides you with everything you need to handle a http-request. It contains the underlying request and response, and a bunch of utility methods to return results, read parameters or pass attributes among filters/routes. The methods are available directly from the callback ( Call is the callback receiver). You can check the API documentation for the full list of methods. This sample code illustrates the usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 get ( \"/call\" ) { attributes // the attributes list attributes [ \"foo\" ] // value of foo attribute attributes [ \"A\" ] = \"V\" // sets value of attribute A to V ok ( \"Response body\" ) // returns a 200 status send ( 400 , \"Invalid request\" ) // returns any status } Request \u00b6 Request functionality is provided by the request field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 get ( \"/request\" ) { // URL Information request . method // the HTTP method (GET, ..etc) request . scheme // http or https request . secure // true if scheme is https request . host // the host, e.g. \"example.com\" request . ip // client IP address request . port // the server port request . path // the request path, e.g. /result.jsp request . body // request body sent by the client request . url // the url. e.g. \"http://example.com/foo\" // Headers request . headers // the HTTP header list with first values only request . headers [ \"BAR\" ] // first value of BAR header request . headersValues // the HTTP header list with their full values list request . headersValues [ \"BAR\" ] // list of values of BAR header // Common headers shortcuts request . contentType // content type of request.body request . acceptValues // Client accepted content types request . userAgent // user agent (browser requests) request . origin // origin (browser requests) // Parameters request . pathParameters // map with all path parameters request . formParameters // map with first values of all form fields request . formParametersValues // map with all form fields values request . queryParameters // map with first values of all query parameters request . queryParametersValues // map with all query parameters values // Body processing request . contentLength // length of request body request . body ( Type :: class ) // Object passed in the body as a typed object request . body < Type > () // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . bodyObjects ( Type :: class ) // Object(s) passed in the body as a typed list request . bodyObjects < Type > () // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . body ( Map :: class ) // Object passed in the body as a field map request . body < Map <* , *>> () // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . bodyObjects ( Map :: class ) // Object(s) passed in the body as a list of maps request . bodyObjects < Map <* , *>> () // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement } Path Parameters \u00b6 Route patterns can include named parameters, accessible via the pathParameters map on the request object: 1 2 3 4 get ( \"/pathParam/{foo}\" ) { request . pathParameters [ \"foo\" ] // value of foo path parameter request . pathParameters // map with all parameters } Query Parameters \u00b6 It is possible to access the whole query string or only a specific query parameter using the parameters map on the request object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 get ( \"/queryParam\" ) { request . queryString request . queryParameters // the query param list request . queryParameters [ \"FOO\" ] // value of FOO query param request . queryParametersValues // the query param list request . queryParametersValues [ \"FOO\" ] // all values of FOO query param } Form Parameters \u00b6 HTML Form processing. Don't parse body! 1 2 3 4 5 6 get ( \"/formParam\" ) { request . formParameters // the query param list request . formParameters [ \"FOO\" ] // value of FOO query param request . formParametersValues // the query param list request . formParametersValues [ \"FOO\" ] // all values of FOO query param } File Uploads \u00b6 Multipart Requests 1 2 3 4 post ( \"/file\" ) { val filePart = request . parts [ \"file\" ] ?: error ( \"File not available\" ) ok ( filePart . inputStream . reader (). readText ()) } Response \u00b6 Response information is provided by the response field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/response\" ) { response . body // get response content response . body = \"Hello\" // sets content to Hello response . headers [ \"FOO\" ] = \"bar\" // sets header FOO with single value bar response . headersValues [ \"FOO\" ] = listOf ( \"bar\" ) // sets header FOO values with [ bar ] response . status // get the response status response . status = 401 // set status code to 401 response . contentType // get the content type response . contentType = \"text/xml\" // set content type to text/xml } Redirects \u00b6 You can redirect requests (returning 30x codes) by using Call utility methods: 1 2 3 get ( \"/redirect\" ) { redirect ( \"/call\" ) // browser redirect to /call } Cookies \u00b6 The request and response cookie functions provide a convenient way for sharing information between handlers, requests, or even servers. You can read client sent cookies from the request's cookies read only map. To change cookies or add new ones you have to use response.addCookie() and response.removeCookie() methods. Check the following sample code for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/cookie\" ) { request . cookies // get map of all request cookies request . cookies [ \"foo\" ] // access request cookie by name val cookie = Cookie ( \"new_foo\" , \"bar\" ) response . addCookie ( cookie ) // set cookie with a value response . addCookie ( cookie . copy ( maxAge = 3600 )) // set cookie with a max-age response . addCookie ( cookie . copy ( secure = true )) // secure cookie response . removeCookie ( \"foo\" ) // remove cookie } Sessions \u00b6 Every request has access to the session created on the server side, the session object provides the following methods: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 get ( \"/session\" ) { session // create and return session session . attributes [ \"user\" ] // Get session attribute 'user' session . set ( \"user\" , \"foo\" ) // Set session attribute 'user' session . removeAttribute ( \"user\" ) // Remove session attribute 'user' session . attributes // Get all session attributes session . id // Get session id session . isNew () // Check if session is new } Compression \u00b6 Halting \u00b6 To immediately stop a request within a filter or route use halt() . halt() is not intended to be used inside exception-mappers. Check the following snippet for an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/halt\" ) { halt () // halt with status 500 and stop route processing /* * These are just examples the following code will never be reached */ halt ( 401 ) // halt with status halt ( \"Body Message\" ) // halt with message (status 500) halt ( 401 , \"Go away!\" ) // halt with status and message } Filters \u00b6 You might know filters as interceptors, or middleware from other libraries. Filters are blocks of code executed before or after one or more routes. They can read the request and read/modify the response. All filters that match a route are executed in the order they are declared. Filters optionally take a pattern, causing them to be executed only if the request path matches that pattern. Before and after filters are always executed (if the route is matched). However, any of them may stop the execution chain if halted. If halt() is called in one filter, filter processing is stopped for that kind of filter ( before or after ). In the case of before filters, this also prevent the route from being executed (but after filters are executed anyway). The following code details filters usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 before { response . headersValues [ \"b_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters/route\" ) { ok ( \"filters route\" ) } after ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"a_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"filters\" ) } path ( \"/nested\" ) { before { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested_2\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"nested filters\" ) } get ( \"/halted\" ) { halt ( 499 , \"halted\" ) } get { ok ( \"nested also\" ) } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } Error Handling \u00b6 You can provide handlers for runtime errors. Errors are unhandled thrown exceptions in the callbacks, or handlers halted with an error code. Error handlers for a given code or exception are unique, and the first one defined is the one which will be used. HTTP Errors Handlers \u00b6 Allows handling routes halted with a given code. These handlers are only applied if the route is halted, if the error code is returned with send it won't be handled as an error. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes halted with 512 code error ( 512 ) { send ( 500 , \"Ouch\" )} // If status code (512) is returned with `send` error won't be triggered get ( \"/errors\" ) { halt ( 512 ) } Exception Mapping \u00b6 You can handle exceptions of a given type for all routes and filters. The handler allows you to refer to the thrown exception. Look at the following code for a detailed example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes which callbacks throw exceptions error ( CodedException :: class ) { send ( 599 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } error ( IllegalStateException :: class ) { send ( 505 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } get ( \"/exceptions\" ) { error ( \"Message\" ) } get ( \"/codedExceptions\" ) { halt ( 509 , \"code\" ) } Static Files \u00b6 You can use a folder in the classpath for serving static files with the get() methods. Note that the public directory name is not included in the URL. Asset mapping is handled like any other route, so if an asset mapping is matched, no other route will be checked (assets or other routes). Also, if a previous route is matched, the asset mapping will never be checked. Being get(resource) a shortcut of get(\"/*\", resource) it should be placed as the last route. Check the next example for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 get ( \"/web/file.txt\" ) { ok ( \"It matches this route and won't search for the file\" ) } // Expose resources on the '/public' resource folder over the '/web' HTTP path get ( \"/web/*\" , URL ( \"classpath:public\" )) // Maps resources on 'assets' on the server root (assets/f.css -> /f.css) // '/public/css/style.css' resource would be: 'http://{host}:{port}/css/style.css' get ( URL ( \"classpath:assets\" )) MIME types \u00b6 The MIME types of static files are computed from the file extension using the SerializationManager.contentTypeOf() method. CORS \u00b6 CORS behaviour can be different depending on the path. You can attach different CorsSettings to different routers. Check CorsSettings class for more details. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 val server : Server = Server ( adapter ) { corsPath ( \"/default\" , CorsSettings ()) corsPath ( \"/example/org\" , CorsSettings ( \"example.org\" )) corsPath ( \"/no/credentials\" , CorsSettings ( supportCredentials = false )) corsPath ( \"/only/post\" , CorsSettings ( allowedMethods = setOf ( POST ))) corsPath ( \"/cache\" , CorsSettings ( preFlightMaxAge = 10 )) corsPath ( \"/exposed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( exposedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) corsPath ( \"/allowed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( allowedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) } private fun Router . corsPath ( path : String , settings : CorsSettings ) { path ( path ) { // CORS settings can change for different routes cors ( settings ) get ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } post ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } put ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } delete ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } get { ok ( request . method ) } post { ok ( request . method ) } put { ok ( request . method ) } delete { ok ( request . method ) } } } HTTPS \u00b6 It is possible to start a secure server enabling HTTPS. For this, you have to provide a server certificate and its key in the server's SslSettings . Once you use a server certificate, it is also possible to serve content using HTTP/2 , for this to work, ALPN is required (however, this is already handled if you use Java 11). The certificate common name should match the host that will serve the content in order to be accepted by an HTTP client without a security error. There is a Gradle helper to create sample certificates for development purposes. HTTP clients can also be configured to use a certificate. This is required to implement a double ended authorization ( mutual TLS ). This is also done by passing a SslSettings object the HTTP client. If you want to implement mutual trust, you must enforce client certificate in the server configuration (check SslSettings.clientAuth ). If this is done, you can access the certificate the client used to connect (assuming it is valid, if not the connection will end with an error) with the Request.certificateChain property. Below you can find a simple example to set up an HTTPS server and client with mutual TLS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 // Key store files val identity = \"hexagonkt.p12\" val trust = \"trust.p12\" // Default passwords are file name reversed val keyStorePassword = identity . reversed () val trustStorePassword = trust . reversed () // Key stores can be set as URIs to classpath resources (the triple slash is needed) val keyStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ identity \" ) val trustStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ trust \" ) val sslSettings = SslSettings ( keyStore = keyStore , keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword , trustStore = trustStore , trustStorePassword = trustStorePassword , clientAuth = true // Requires a valid certificate from the client (mutual TLS) ) val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( bindPort = 0 , protocol = HTTPS , // You can also use HTTP2 sslSettings = sslSettings ) val server = serve ( serverSettings , serverAdapter ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { // We can access the certificate used by the client from the request val subjectDn = request . certificate ?. subjectDN ?. name response . headers [ \"cert\" ] = subjectDn ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } // We'll use the same certificate for the client (in a real scenario it would be different) val clientSettings = ClientSettings ( sslSettings = sslSettings ) // Create a HTTP client and make a HTTPS request val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"https://localhost: ${ server . runtimePort } \" , clientSettings ) client . get ( \"/hello\" ). apply { logger . debug { body } // Assure the certificate received (and returned) by the server is correct assert ( headers . require ( \"cert\" ). first (). startsWith ( \"CN=hexagonkt.com\" )) assert ( body == \"Hello World!\" ) } Testing \u00b6 Integration tests \u00b6 To test HTTP servers from outside using a real Adapter, you can create a server setting 0 as port. This will pick a random free port which you can check later: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 val router = Router { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hi!\" ) } } val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( InetAddress . getLoopbackAddress (), 0 , banner = \"name\" ) val server = Server ( adapter , router , serverSettings ) server . start () val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost: ${ server . runtimePort } \" ) assert ( client . get ( \"/hello\" ). body == \"Hi!\" ) server . stop () To do this kind of tests without creating a custom server (using the real production code). Check the tests of the starter projects . If you have an OpenAPI/Swagger spec defined for your server, you can also make use of the mock server ( see below ). Mocking calls \u00b6 To unit test callbacks you can create test calls with hardcoded requests, responses and sessions. To use it in your project you'll have to include a dependency (with test scope): build.gradle 1 2 3 4 5 repositories { mavenCentral () } testImplementation ( \"com.hexagonkt:http_server:$hexagonVersion:test\" ) pom.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 <dependency> <groupId> com.hexagonkt </groupId> <artifactId> http_server </artifactId> <version> $hexagonVersion </version> <scope> test </scope> </dependency> Check testCall , TestRequest , TestResponse and TestSession for more details. For a quick sample, check the snipped below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 private fun Call . testedCallback () { if ( request . body == \"weird\" ) send ( 999 , \"Weird error\" ) } @Test fun `Test call behaves as expected` () { val testCall = testCall ( TestRequest ( body = \"weird\" )) testCall . testedCallback () assert ( testCall . response . status == 999 ) assert ( testCall . response . body == \"Weird error\" ) } OpenAPI Mock Server \u00b6 The mock server is able to create and return a Server from the information of an OpenAPI/Swagger spec file. The path to the spec file can either be a URL or a local file. It can be either in JSON or YAML format. The mock server takes all its data from the spec and the request and response of the routes is determined by the routes' examples and schemas. During handling of a request, the mock server validates the request parameters against those specified in the spec file and returns an appropriate response from the provided examples . If any authentication requirements are specified, they are validated as well. How to Use \u00b6 First, add the required dependencies: 1 2 implementation ( \"com.hexagonkt:http_server: $ hexagonVersion :test\" ) implementation ( \"io.swagger.parser.v3:swagger-parser: $ swaggerParserVersion \" ) To create the mock server object: 1 val mockServer = MockServer ( \"https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json\" ) Optionally, you can also explicitly specify a port number: 1 val mockServer = MockServer ( \"https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json\" , port = 9090 ) To get the actual server object: 1 val server = mockServer . server Finally, to run the server: 1 server . start () OpenAPI Spec File Requirements \u00b6 The file provided should be a syntactically valid OpenAPI spec file. If it is not, an error will be raised at initialization time. For each path in the spec file, descriptions for 200 and 400 (in case parameter verification fails) status codes must be provided. If the path contains authentication requirements, a 401 status code description must also be provided. In addition, for each status code, at least one example must be provided. Note that, at present, only the application/json media type is supported. Supported Authentication Methods \u00b6 Currently, the following Authentication methods/mechanisms are supported: API Key authentication (key may be present in the headers, query parameters or cookies) HTTP Authentication (Basic or Bearer authentication) Providing Examples \u00b6 There are several ways to define response examples in an OpenAPI spec file. If there are multiple examples defined for a particular path status code, you can specify a particular response by using the X-Mock-Response-Example header with the name of the desired example. The mock server follows the following priority order when parsing the spec file for examples: 1. If the X-Mock-Response-Example header is present, then the example corresponding to the value of that header is immediately fetched and returned. 2. If no X-Mock-Response-Example header is present, it first tries to fetch an example from the schema key within the media type object. 3. If no example is found here, it then attempts to fetch the example from the example key in the media type object. 4. Next, it attempts to fetch the first value found in the examples key of the media type object. 5. If still no example is found, it simply raises an exception. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : { \"example\" : \"This value is checked first\" }, \"example\" : \"This value is checked second\" , \"examples\" : { \"example1\" : { \"value\" : \"This value is checked third\" }, \"example2\" : { \"value\" : \"This value would be returned if the X-Mock-Response-Example header is passed with value 'example2'\" } } } } Package com.hexagonkt.http.server \u00b6 This package defines the classes used in the HTTP DSL.","title":"HTTP Server"},{"location":"http_server/#module-http_server","text":"This port's purpose is to develop HTTP servers (REST services or Web applications).

Paths must start with '/' and trailing slash is ignored. A callback code block. The callback has a void return type. You should use Call.send() to set the response which will be returned to the user.

For this, you have to provide a server certificate and its key in the server's SslSettings . Once you use a server certificate, it is also possible to serve content using HTTP/2 , for this to work, ALPN is required (however, this is already handled if you use Java 11). The certificate common name should match the host that will serve the content in order to be accepted by an HTTP client without a security error. There is a Gradle helper to create sample certificates for development purposes. HTTP clients can also be configured to use a certificate. This is required to implement a double ended authorization ( mutual TLS ). This is also done by passing a SslSettings object the HTTP client. If you want to implement mutual trust, you must enforce client certificate in the server configuration (check SslSettings.clientAuth ). If this is done, you can access the certificate the client used to connect (assuming it is valid, if not the connection will end with an error) with the Request.certificateChain property. Below you can find a simple example to set up an HTTPS server and client with mutual TLS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 // Key store files val identity = \"hexagonkt.p12\" val trust = \"trust.p12\" // Default passwords are file name reversed val keyStorePassword = identity . reversed () val trustStorePassword = trust . reversed () // Key stores can be set as URIs to classpath resources (the triple slash is needed) val keyStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ identity \" ) val trustStore = URL ( \"classpath:ssl/ $ trust \" ) val sslSettings = SslSettings ( keyStore = keyStore , keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword , trustStore = trustStore , trustStorePassword = trustStorePassword , clientAuth = true // Requires a valid certificate from the client (mutual TLS) ) val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( bindPort = 0 , protocol = HTTPS , // You can also use HTTP2 sslSettings = sslSettings ) val server = serve ( serverSettings , serverAdapter ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { // We can access the certificate used by the client from the request val subjectDn = request . certificate ?. subjectDN ?. name response . headers [ \"cert\" ] = subjectDn ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } // We'll use the same certificate for the client (in a real scenario it would be different) val clientSettings = ClientSettings ( sslSettings = sslSettings ) // Create a HTTP client and make a HTTPS request val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"https://localhost: ${ server . runtimePort } \" , clientSettings ) client . get ( \"/hello\" ). apply { logger . debug { body } // Assure the certificate received (and returned) by the server is correct assert ( headers . require ( \"cert\" ). first (). startsWith ( \"CN=hexagonkt.com\" )) assert ( body == \"Hello World!\" ) }","title":"HTTPS"},{"location":"http_server/#testing","text":"","title":"Testing"},{"location":"http_server/#integration-tests","text":"To test HTTP servers from outside using a real Adapter, you can create a server setting 0 as port.
