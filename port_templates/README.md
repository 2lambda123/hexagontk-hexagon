TODO

### Install the Dependency
This module is not meant to be used directly. You should include any Adapter implementing this
feature (as [templates_pebble] and/or [templates_freemarker]) in order to process templates.

You can use many adapters in the same application to be able to handle different template engines at
the same time.

[templates_pebble]: /templates_pebble
[templates_freemarker]: /templates_freemarker
