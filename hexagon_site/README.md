# Project Site

The site is generated using [MkDocs] and uses [Google Analytics] for usage statistics. The MkDocs
theme used is [MkDocs Material].

To generate the site use: `./gradlew buildSite` which executes:
`docker-compose run site build -csq`. You can check more details [here][site build].

To run the site inside a server for development, execute: `gw serveSite`. The site will be served
at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can also build the site and serve the
`build` directory using: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

The site properties are loaded from `mkdocs.yml` file. The content from `pages` is copied to
`content` in order to add the API Markdown to content.

As `content` directory is created from `pages` processed content, it should be ignored by SCM, and
it will be deleted by the clean task.

The site takes the Dokka API generated by all modules and add it to the site.

Pages have a header with a button to edit the content in [GitHub] and use [Disqus] to add comments
to each of them.
