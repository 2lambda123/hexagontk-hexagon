# Project Site

The site is generated using [MkDocs] and uses [Google Analytics] for usage statistics. The MkDocs
theme used is [MkDocs Material].

To generate the site you *MUST BUILD THE PROJECT* previously (`./gradlew build`), after that you can
use: `./gradlew buildSite` which executes: `docker run <mkdocs_material_image> build -csq`. You can
check more details [here][site build].

To run the site inside a server for development, execute: `./gradlew serveSite`. The site will be
served at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can also build the site and serve the
`build` directory using: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Remember to stop the site server after using
it with: `docker stop hexagon_site`. You can do altogether with:
`./gradlew serveSite || docker stop hexagon_site`.

The site properties are loaded from `mkdocs.yml` file. The content from `pages` is copied to
`content` in order to add the API Markdown to content.

As `content` directory is created from `pages` processed content, it should be ignored by SCM, and
it will be deleted by the clean task.

The site takes the Dokka API generated by all modules and add it to the site.

Pages have a header with a button to edit the content in [GitHub].
