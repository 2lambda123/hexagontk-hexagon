**DISCLAIMER**: The project status is beta. Use it at your own risk. There are some modules not
started yet (ie: metrics and remote configuration) and the API is subject to change any time prior
to release 1.0.

Performance is not the primary goal, but it is taken seriously. You can check performance numbers
in the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks][benchmark]

Tests, of course, are taken into account. This is the coverage grid:
